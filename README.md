This challange was used to test our capabilities with spark.
we had to read in a csv file and then answer questions using spark from the df we created.

Completion process I would first attempt to solve each of the tasks using my memory, then I would look into the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when I was lost. After doing these steps I would consult ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong and would use its assistance to correct the code as well as explain its process to me so I could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid. When all else failed i would utalize the help of my fellow classmates and instructors to guide me in the right path
